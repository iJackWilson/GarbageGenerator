# Garbage Generator
## Why?

I'm trying to get better at Go, so I'm porting some of the scripts I frequently use for pentesting from bash and Python to Go.


## V1
The current version takes a user argument for length of garbage to generate and outputs to a result.txt.

## Future plans
* Take a user argument for a filename to output to.
* Add an equivalent of [pattern_offset.rb](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb)
* Take user arguments as flags
* Add a -h/--help flag
